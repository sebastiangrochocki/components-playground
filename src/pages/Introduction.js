          Why Design Systems Matter
        </Heading>
        <Paragraph size="large">
          Design System documentation acts as a bridge between design and
          development. Over my decade-long career as a product designer, I've
          grappled with connecting non-technical individuals, striving to
          streamline component usage to reduce time-to-market costs. In my
          previous role, I collaborated with 55+ product designers, encompassing
          accessibility, localization, and content guidelines. This experience
          illuminated how Design Systems can tackle issues like diminishing
          technical debt and mitigating costs tied to design and accessibility
          audits.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph size="large">
          This is the essence of why documentation is pivotalâ€”it fosters
          connectivity among people and encourages the widespread adoption of
          Design Systems.
