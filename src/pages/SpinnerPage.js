            The Spinner component is a React component designed to display an
            animated spinner, typically used as a loading indicator. It uses
            lottie-react to render a Lottie animation, providing a visually
            appealing and smooth animation for indicating loading or processing
            states in your application.

            One common design pattern involving avatars is to use them in user
            profiles, where they represent the user's identity visually. Another
            example is in messaging applications, where avatars can be used to
            display the profile pictures of the sender or recipient next to the
            message.
